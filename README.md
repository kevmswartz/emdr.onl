**Live at: [emdr.onl](https://emdr.onl)**

---

This is a simple, browser-based tool designed to provide a guided Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) experience for wellness purposes. It was developed to be a clean, accessible, and user-friendly digital aid for bilateral stimulation.

This project was **vibe coded**â€”built intuitively with a focus on creating a calm and supportive user experience.

## Key Features

*   **Two Modes:** Choose between a **Guided Session** that walks you through preparation or a **Quick Start** to jump directly into the EMDR exercise.
*   **Customizable Session:** Adjust the speed, duration, dot size, dot color, and bilateral audio to match your comfort level.
*   **Guided Journaling:** Prompts to help you identify and process memories, thoughts, and feelings before and after a set.
*   **Local Storage:** All your settings and session history are saved directly in your browser, ensuring your data remains private.
*   **Session History:** Review past sessions to track your progress over time.
*   **Dark & Light Modes:** Switch between themes for your visual comfort.
*   **Fully Responsive:** Designed to work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
